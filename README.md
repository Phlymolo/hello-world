# hello-world
My first repository

The tutorial says to write some stuff about myself in this branch. I don't think there's anything particularly memorable to share, so instead I'll leave you with two pieces of advice. The first of which, is never get involved in a land war in Asia. I can't think of anything else actually. That is all.
